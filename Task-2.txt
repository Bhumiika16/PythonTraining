1 - Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
    If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
    If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “Python Training” as a string
    If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd - Python Training” as a string.

number = int(input())
if(number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0):
    print("Consultadd - Python Training")
elif(number % 3 == 0):
    print("Consultadd")
elif(number % 5 == 0):
    print("Python Training")
else:
    pass


2 - Write a program in Python to perform the following operator based task:
    Ask user to choose the following option first:
    If User Enter 1 - Addition
    If User Enter 2 - Subtraction
    If User Enter 3 - Division
    If User Enter 4 - Multiplication
    If User Enter 5 - Average
    Ask user to enter two numbers and keep those numbers in variables num1 and num2 respectively for the first 4 options mentioned above.
    Ask the user to enter two more numbers as first and second for calculating the average as soon as the user chooses an option 5.
    At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “NEGATIVE”
    NOTE: At a time a user can only perform one action.

num = int(input("Enter Number between 1 to 5 : "))
if(num >= 1 and num <= 4):
    num1 = int(input())
    num2 = int(input())
    if(num == 1):
        result = num1 + num2
    elif(num == 2):
        result = num1 - num2
    elif(num == 3):
        result = num1/num2
    else:
        result = num1 * num2
    if(result >= 0):
        print(result)
    else:
        print('NEGATIVE')
elif(num == 5):
    first = int(input())
    second = int(input())
    

3 - Write a program in Python to implement the given flowchart.

a , b , c = 10 , 20 , 30
avg = (a + b + c)/3
print("avg = ",avg)
if(avg > a and avg > b and avg > c):
    print("avg is higher than a,b and c")
elif(avg > a and avg > b):
    print("avg is higher than a,b")
elif(avg > a and avg > c):
    print("avg is higher than a,c")
elif(avg > b and avg > c):
    print("avg is higher than b,c")
elif(avg > a):
    print("avg is higher than a")
elif(avg > b):
    print("avg is higher than b")
else:
    print("avg is higher than c")


4 - Write a program in Python to break and continue if the following cases occurs:
    If user enters a negative number just break the loop and print “It’s Over”
    If user enters a positive number just continue in the loop and print “Good Going”

while(True):
    num = int(input())
    if(num >= 0):
        print("Keep Going")
        continue
    else:
        print("It's Over")
        break


5 - Write a program in Python which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200.

num = int(input())
if(num >= 2000 and num <= 3200 and num % 7 == 0 and num % 5 != 0):
    print("Correct Number")
else:
    print("Wrong Number")


6 - What is the output of the following code examples?

    A - x=123
        for i in x:
          print(i)

output - 1
         2
         3

    B - i = 0
        while i < 5:
          print(i)
          i += 1
          if i == 3:
            break
          else:
            print(“error”)

output - 0
         error
         1 
         error
         2
         error

    C - count = 0
        while True:
           print(count)
           count += 1
           if count >= 5:
              Break

output - 1
         2
         3
         4
         5

7 - Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
    Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5

for i in range(7):
    if(i != 0 and i % 3 == 0):
        continue
    else:
        print(i,end = " ")


8 - Write a program that accepts a string as an input from the user and calculate the number of digits and letters. 

string = input()
digits , letters = 0 , 0
for i in string:
    if(ord(i) >= 48 and ord(i) <= 57):
        digits += 1
    else:
        letters += 1
print('Letters :',letters)
print('Digits : ', digits)


9 - A - Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”. If the correct number is guessed the program stops, otherwise it continues forever.

while(True):
    lucky_num = int(input())
    if(lucky_num == 7):
        break
    else:
        print("Guess the lucky number")

    B - Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time. Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and ‘answer’ for the answer to the question whether they want to continue guessing. The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or answers “no”.

while(True):
    number = int(input())
    if(number == 7):
        break
    else:
        answer = input(("Want to guess the lucky number?"))
        if(answer == 'no'):
            break
        else:
            continue
        

10 - . Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number. Use a while loop and a counter, such as
       counter = 1
       While counter <= 5:
         print(“Type in the”, counter, “number”
         counter=counter+1
       The program asks for five guesses (no matter whether the correct number was guessed or not). If the correct number is guessed, the program outputs “Good guess!”, otherwise it outputs “Try again!”. After the fifth guess it stops and prints “Game over!”.

counter = 1
while(counter <= 5):
    lucky_num = int(input())
    if(lucky_num == 7):
        print("Good guess!")
    else:
        print("Try again!")
    counter += 1
print("Game over")


11 - In the previous question, insert break after the “Good guess!” print statement. break will terminate the while loop so that users do not have to continue guessing after they found the number. If the user does not guess the number at all, print “Sorry but that was not very successful”.

counter = 1
while(counter <= 5):
    lucky_num = int(input())
    if(lucky_num == 7):
        print("Good guess!")
        break
    elif(counter == 5):
        print("Sorry but that was not very successful")
    else:
        print("Try again!")
    counter += 1
