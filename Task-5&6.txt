def decorator(original_func):
    
    def wrap():
        print("Hello")
        
        original_func()

original()


8 - For a given string swap cases i.e. upper cases letters to lower case and vice versa.

s = "HackerRank.com presents Pythonist 2."
x = []
for i in range(len(s)):
    if(ord(s[i]) >= 65 and ord(s[i]) <= 90):
        x.append(s[i].lower())
    elif(ord(s[i]) >= 97 and ord(s[i]) <= 122):
        x.append(s[i].upper())
    else:
        x.append(s[i])
print("".join(x))


9 - Write a program in Python to allow the error of syntax to be handled usingexception handling.

    printf(b)

except:
    print("There is a syntax error.")


10 - 


11 - Write a program to handle an error if the user entered a number more than four digits it shouldreturn “The length is too short/long !!! Please provide only four digits”.

            myfunc(count)
        

username = input("Enter username : ")
result = myfunc(0)


13 - Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string fromthe file. Consider the content of doc.txt as given below:
Hello I am a file
Where you need to return the data string
Which is of even length
Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present.

file = open("doc.txt" , "r")
for i in file:
    string = i.split()
    for word in string:
        if(len(word) % 2 == 0):
            print(word,end = " ")


14 - Write a program in Python to find out the character in a string which is uppercase using listcomprehension.

string = input()
result = [letter for letter in string if ord(letter) >= 65 and ord(letter) <= 90]
print(result)


15 - Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students andtheir corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.Let’s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
Sample input: students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
Expected output: {‘Smit’ : ’CSE’ , ’Jaya’ : ’Networking’ , ’Rayyan’ : ’Operating System’}

students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] 
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
dictionary = {}

for i,j in zip(students,subjects):
    dictionary[i] = j
    
print(dictionary)


16 - Write a program in Python using generators to reverse the string.
Input String = “Consultadd Training”

def myfunc(string):
    mystring = string.split()
    for i in mystring:
        for j in range(len(i)):
            yield i[len(i)-1-j]
            
        yield(" ")


string = 'Consultadd Training'
for x in myfunc(string):
    print(x,end="")
